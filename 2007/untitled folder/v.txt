Answer 1:
This aggregate is not in 1NF because detailing can have more than one values means there
isn't one and only one corresponding value of the non-key attributes.So, it is , violating the atomicity requirement.

Answer 2:
In the data "Owner's Last Name" and "Owner's Phone Number" are functionally dependent upon the
primary key but "Owner's Phone Number" is also dependent upon the "Owner's Last Name".
 So, there is there are transitive dependencies between non-key attributes, Which means data is not in Third Normal Form.

Answer 3:
Appointments: {Date, Time, VehiclePlate,VehicleModel,OwnerPhoneNumber}
Details:{Date, Time,Detailing}
Owners:{OwnerPhoneNumber,OwnerLastName}..............Don't forget to underline it

Suppose that an auto detailing company records appointments in a table in a spreadsheet like this:

Appointments

Date	   Time	VehiclePlate	VehicleModel	Owner's Last Name	Owner's Phone Number	Detailing
Apr 18,2023 9am	HER841	     Dodge Dart	           Howard	              555-2381	     interior supreme, exterior supreme

Apr 18,2023 10am JBJ267	        GMC Terrain        	Gallagher	          555-3619	       exterior standard
Apr 18,2023 1pm  JCB581	     Audi A4	            Mortimer	          555-0856	       exterior supreme
Apr 18 2023,2pm	 HVP802	       Ford F150	         McQueen	           557-2428	    interior standard, exterior supreme
...						
Apr 19,2023 9am	JAR156	     Alfa 156            	Carraclough          	554-8652	interior supreme, exterior supreme
...						
...and now suppose that we're going to build a database for them.

NOTE: Things that we will take to be true for this scenario (even if some are unlikely in real life):

There is at most one appointment booked at any time of day
so we can determine that {Date, Time} is a candidate key
A person might own more than one vehicle
A person's phone number never changes and is unique
Every vehicle has a unique license plate number
Detailing comes in two categories (interior and exterior) and for each category is offered at two levels (standard or supreme)
 
Questions

1. Explain why the data in the table is not in First Normal Form. [5 marks]

2. Explain why the data in the table is not in Third Normal Form. [5 marks]

For this question you cannot say "Because it's not in First (or Second) Normal Form".  You need to explain why specifically it is not in Third Normal Form.
3. Reorganize the attributes into Third Normal Form (create separate aggregates that conform to 3NF). [20 marks]

Give each aggregate an appropriate name.
Underline the candidate key for each aggregate.
